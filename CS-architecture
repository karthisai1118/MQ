Client server architecture:
----------------------------
Linux Server ( MQ is installed and running) – MQ Server:
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install MQ  Server software (We already aware how to install it). All instruction are provided in my IBM MQ Beginners course. Kindly refer it
2. Create a queue manager, create a local queue inside the queue manager
3. Create a server connection channel
	DEFINE CHANNEL(SVR1) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)
	
4. Create a listener and then start the listener
5. Set the authorizations to the queue manager and queue
		- OAM --> Object Authority Manager (If the client is having CONNECT access to the qmgr or not)
			setmqaut -m QM1 -t qmgr -p dell +connect
			dspmqaut -m QM1 -t qmgr -p dell
		
		- ACL --> Access Control List
			setmqaut -m QM1 -n QL1 -t q -p dell +put
			dspmqaut -m QM1 -n QL1 -t q -p dell

Windows Server (application is running) – MQ Client:
------------------------------------------------
1. MQ Client software installation in windows
2. Set an environment variable for MQSERVER parameter. Environment variable  means just to provide an instruction to the operating system
	Syntax: SET MQSERVER=svr-chl-name/tcp/mq-hostname(port)
	    Eg: SET MQSERVER=SVR1/tcp/192.168.136.128(1425)

3. Now try to put and get the messages using amqsputc and amqsgetc programs

Precautions:
------------
1. There must be no firewall issues and network issues between your windows client and MQ Server
2. The MQ listener port should always open from MQ client (windows server) to MQ Server (Linux server)
3. There must be proper authentication, authorization permissions should be set. Kindly refer my “Security in IBM MQ” section in this course for better understanding of authentication and authorization
