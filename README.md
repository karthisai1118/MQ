# MQ
Detail description on MQ Installation, configuration and complete setup.

I. what is MQ?

 MQ, or Message Queue, is a system for enabling applications to communicate reliably and asynchronously by temporarily storing messages in queues. IBM MQ is a prominent product in this category, providing a messaging middleware that connects applications across different platforms, ensures data security, and offers high availability for reliable message exchange even during network issues. It uses components like queue managers and queues to manage and transfer messages, making it a key technology for mission-critical systems in banking, healthcare, and manufacturing.  
II. How MQ Works

a) Asynchronous Communication:
Applications don't need to wait for a response in real-time. One application can send a message to a queue, and another can pick it up and process it when it's ready. 

b) Queues and Queue Managers:
A queue is a data structure that holds messages. A queue manager is a system service that acts as a logical container for queues, responsible for transferring messages between them and across different managers. 
c) Reliability:
MQ systems are designed to ensure that messages are not lost or duplicated, even if there are network failures or the applications are temporarily unavailable. 
III. Key Components

a) Message Queue Interface (MQI): A low-level API that applications use to read and write messages to queues. 

b) Message Channel: A connection that transfers data between different queue managers. 
Local Queue Object: An identifier for a queue that is on the same queue manager as the application. 
c) Remote Queue Object: An identifier for a queue located on a different queue manager. 
IV. Benefits of Using MQ

a) High Availability and Reliability:
Guarantees that messages are delivered and processed without loss. 

b) Application Connectivity:
Connects applications running on different machines and platforms, even in distributed environments. 
c) Security:
Provides standard protection options, end-to-end encryption, and integrity checks to secure data in transit. 
d) Scalability:
Can be used in various environments, including cloud computing, to handle large volumes of messages. 
e) Batch Processing:
Can process transactions in batches as computing resources and bandwidth become available.
